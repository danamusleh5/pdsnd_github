# Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Date Created
January 26, 2025

### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Description
This Python program analyzes bikeshare data for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It provides users with the ability to filter the data by month (from January to June) and day of the week, allowing for tailored analysis. The program calculates and displays various statistics that help explore the bikeshare system, such as:

- **Most frequent travel times** (month, day, hour)
- **Most popular stations** (start and end stations)
- **Most frequent trips** (combination of start and end stations)
- **Trip duration statistics** (total and average trip time)
- **User demographics** (user type, gender, birth year)

These insights can be used to identify trends and patterns in the bikeshare system, providing valuable information for decision-making or research.

### Files Used
The program requires CSV files containing data for each city. These files should be placed in the same directory as the script, or the file paths can be adjusted accordingly:

1. `chicago.csv`
2. `new_york_city.csv`
3. `washington.csv`

The CSV files must contain relevant data columns such as `Start Time`, `End Time`, `Trip Duration`, `Start Station`, `End Station`, `User Type`, `Gender`, and `Birth Year`.

### Credits
This project is based on the Udacity Data Science program and was developed with guidance from their course content and resources. Special thanks to **Udacity** for providing the foundation and support for this project.
